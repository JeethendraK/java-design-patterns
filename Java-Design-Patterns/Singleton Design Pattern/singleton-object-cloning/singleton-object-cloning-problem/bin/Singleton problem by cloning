🧩 Cloning Problems in Singleton Classes
----------------------------------------
A Singleton class must ensure that only one instance of the class ever exists in the JVM.
However, cloning can silently break this rule.

⚠️ How Cloning Breaks Singleton
----------------------------------------
Even if your class does not implement Cloneable, it can still inherit the behavior if:
•	Any parent class implements Cloneable
•	The parent class overrides and exposes the clone() method
Because of this:
•	The clone() method (from Object) can create a new instance, violating the singleton guarantee.
•	This leads to two separate objects: one created normally and one through cloning.

🧐 Why This Happens
-----------------
•	clone() in Object (visible only in commons utils) is a protected method. (The protected methods of a class is visible only in the immediate subclass of the inheritance hierarchy)
•	Any class can override it and make it public, returning super.clone().
•	If your singleton does not stop this, a caller can simply do:
Printer p2 = (Printer) p1.clone(); // ❌ Breaks Singleton

✅ How to Fix It
-----------------
To preserve Singleton behavior, explicitly block cloning:

@Override
protected Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
    throw new CloneNotSupportedException();
}

This ensures:
---------------
•	No one can clone the Singleton instance.
•	The JVM will enforce Singleton integrity at runtime.


🧠 Important Note: Constructor Is Not Executed During Cloning
-------------------------------------------------------------
When an object is created through the cloning process, the JVM:
•	Creates a new object in memory
•	Copies all the existing field values from the original object
•	Does NOT call the constructor
Why?
-----
Because the clone is created by copying the internal object data (a field-by-field copy), not by constructing a new object through the normal instantiation path.

So:
•	The cloned object is already initialized with the original object’s data.
•	There is no need to execute the constructor separately.
•	Therefore, cloning bypasses constructors entirely.
This is exactly why cloning can break Singleton classes—because it silently creates a second object without invoking the constructor, bypassing the Singleton logic.
