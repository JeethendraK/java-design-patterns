📌 Singleton Design Pattern – Eager Instantiation
🔷 What is Singleton?
A Singleton is a design pattern that ensures:
•	Only one object of a class is ever created.
•	The same object is reused everywhere in the application.
________________________________________
🟧 Eager Instantiation (Early Loading)
In eager instantiation, the Singleton object is created as soon as the class is loaded into memory, even before it is used.

Using a static block or directly creating the object using a static reference variable, we initialize the Singleton object at class loading time.
This object is stored in a private static reference variable like INSTANCE.
This complete process is called eager (or early) instantiation of a Singleton class.
----------------------------------------------
📌 Important Note
Since the Singleton object is created immediately when the class is loaded:
•	There is no conditional check inside the static factory method (getInstance()).
•	The static method always returns the same object without verifying whether it has already been created.
•	Hence, there is no chance of thread switching during object creation.
•	Therefore, eager instantiation is inherently thread-safe in a multithreaded environment.

🟨 Advantages of Eager Instantiation
•	✔ Simple implementation
•	✔ Thread-safe without synchronized blocks
•	✔ Easy to understand and use

🟥 Disadvantages
•	❌ Object is created even if the application never uses it
•	❌ Not suitable for objects that are heavy/expensive to create
•	❌ May waste memory if the instance is never required
