Problem 1:

Creating multiple objects of a Java class in the following situations is a waste of memory:

1) When the class does not have any member variables (attributes/properties/state).
2) When the class has only read-only state (final variables).
3) When the class contains sharable state (such as cache, buffer, etc.).

Solution:
Develop the Java class as a Singleton class. A Singleton ensures that only one object is created for the entire application.
When a class has no state, or only read-only state, or sharable state, a single object can be reused multiple times, which saves memory.

Steps to create a Singleton class with minimum standards:

1) Make the 0-parameter constructor (in fact, all constructors) private.
   This prevents external code from using the `new` operator to create objects.

2) Declare one private static reference variable of the class type.
   This variable holds the reference of the single object that will be created.

   - If the reference variable is null → the Singleton object has not been created yet.
   - If the reference variable contains an address → the Singleton object is already created.

3) Provide a public static factory method (a method responsible for creating objects).
   This method contains the Singleton logic:
   - It checks if the object already exists.
   - If not, it creates the object.
   - It returns the same object every time.


Note:
We cannot always rely on constructor execution to confirm whether an object is created or not, because there are a few exceptional cases:

1) When creating an object of a subclass of an abstract class:
   - The abstract class constructor will also be executed along with the subclass constructor.
   - However, this does NOT mean an object of the abstract class is created.
   - In Java, objects of interfaces and abstract classes cannot be created.

2) When objects are created using cloning or deserialization:
   - Constructors will NOT execute in these processes.
   - This does not mean the object is newly created through normal construction.
   - Therefore, constructor execution alone cannot be used as confirmation of object creation.
